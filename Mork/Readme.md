- Setting and reason for adventuring

Mork was found in a destroyed temple of Shion, all of it's inhabitants slaughtered except him.
He was raised by the Shion's temple priest, aiding in the local temple's reconstruction and took on training as an acolyte. The temple is a holy site, to Shion's followers, often receiving visit from the high priestess to make preach and bless the local populace.
Years later, with Mork now an adult, an orc warband arrived at the temple to raze it to the ground. As the temple followers and the high priestess hid inside the temple, praying and giving offerings, Mork killed the warband leader in combat, repelling the warband.
Mork was celebrated and revered by the local temple, but Mork became disillusioned by the passiveness of the followers and the high priestess. Silently, he rejects that Shion is a god of harvest and fish, and believes that she is actually a god that demand action, combat, and blood. 

- Secrets
Upon seeing Mork after the battle, the High Priestess knew that Mork has been corrupted by an evil power, and knows that he does not believe the Church's beliefs. The blood of the orc leader distorted Mork's belief, rewritten his personal holy book, and fused his helmet to his flesh.
This disgusts her.

The leader of the orc warband that arrived to pillage the temple was the same leader who destroyed it decades ago.
And he is Mork's father, Gork, blessed of Baal.
Mork is known widespread amongst orc raiders for killing his father, one of Baal's blessed warriors. 
Some orcs believe that Baal has directed them to Mork, for one reason or another.
Mork does not know that the orc he killed is his father.

- Misc stuff
Mork religious teacher is dismayed but Mork's lifestyle choice to become an adventurer, but secretly he is relieved that he no longer needs to see him.

Many people of Kivarp know's the story of Mork defending the temple. The story has been retold so many times that it has been distorted where Mork is a holy paladin in shining plate armor, and the orc leader has been replaced 10 foot tall greater demon with two heads.
The few that met Mork have been sorely disillusioned.

Unbeknownst to Mork, he is wanted for crimes during a self described missionary trip to Galathra# TLDR
