# Story
Gork bathed in the blood of the pious innocents. His twin axes cleaved a bloody trail of corpses leading to the stairs of the temple. His warband pillaged and sacked the town, but their crown jewel was in front of them. 
30 Orcs stood behind him, restless and blood fuelled, ready to worship their god Baal in the temple of Shion. Gork saw Baal's vision, the temple burning and blood painted from the walls to the floor of it's grand hall. Their place of worship will be Shion's temple, their offerings will be Shion's priests. 

A temple guard thrusted his spear into Gork. The guard muttered an improvised prayer, and leaned forward with all his weight, and his spear stopped suddenly. It was not buried in flesh, but was held in the left hand of Gork, so tiny was the shaft of the spear that Gork's hand grasped it along with his axe.

*Pathetic* thought Gork. Gork jerked his left hand upwards, wringing the spear from the guards hand and readied his axe for the killing strike.

**WAAAAAAH!** cried an infants voice. The baby cried and thrashed inside a basket that was haphazardly strapped to Gork's back. It's high pitch wailing was similar to the infants Gork and his warband slaughter minutes earlier. However Gork could not kill this baby.

*Should not kill this baby* thought Gork, momentarily distracted by his bastard son. Focus returning, Gork hacked the guard in half, his torso flying airborne, his viscera spilling in such a way reminiscent of how Gork hacked his wife for birthing a half orc to Gork.

*It's crying louder* 
Gork cannot let his half orc bastard distract him, it's annoyance will seed weakness within Gork.

With the guard's spear, Gork launched it to the top of the temple, piercing the heart of a horrified acolyte who witnessed her brother died.

*Baal demands blood and action*
And with that thought, Gork walked up the temple steps.

--- 

Blood and entrails and corpses decorated and profaned the holy temple. An acolyte screamed as Gork ripped her head from her shoulders.
She was the last one, the last pious priest now joined her brethren as a head on the bloodied floor.
So heavy was the slaughterous rampage that it was as if the walls were bleeding themselves. Blood and gore splattered the walls from the corpses Gork's warband threw into the air. A barbarous act of sport cruel camaraderie. 

Gork stood in the middle of it all, eyes closed, he set aflame the spilt blood of the pious through the force of his will alone. A burning sigil of Baal circled around Gork.

**Waaaaah!**
The baby was crying, choking on unholy smoke, it's eye tearing with flames fueled by holy priests.
And most importantly, the baby was distracting Gork.

*It's crying again* thought Gork. Gork needed total concentration, so he put away his bastard away from his mind and focused again. He hoped his child would die from the smoke and heat.

The flames burned brighter and hotter, with such intensity as if it had an unholy will to cleanse the belief of Shion from the temple. The semi blue marbled wall was now scorched red, religious incense now replace with the smell of battle and corpses. 
The fire now raged and his warband shuffled uncomfortable, the pyro searing their bodies as sweat dripped from the temple of their heads to their muscle scarred abs.

Gork closed his eye and received Baal's blessing.

Gork saw a woman dressed in robes magnitudes more elaborate and fanciful than the robes of the slaughtered. Instinctively, he knew she was the high priestess, the highest priestess. With her death would come the death of belief, the belief of Shion and ushering in of Baal.
Slowly, his vision pulled back from the women, revealing her standing within a temple. It is the same temple just profaned, but rebuilt and made more grand and holier than it ever was before.

Gork now knew where, but when is what he now needs to know. When will the highest priestess will be at this temple, so that Gork may end her weak religion. 

The voice of Baal was heard, and it whispered the time of her death. So softly, so quietly that Baal could barely hear it. Thi--

**WAAAAAAAAH!**

The vision was gone, Gork's focus broken by his bastard. The flames snuffed out so suddenly, the orange tint of burning blood was gone, and the cold aura of Shion's blue returned.
Annoyed, Gork closed his eyes again, but no vision came. No voices heard. Gork willed it, but the flames of ritual would not ignite again. 

Gork erupted, furious and bellowing a scream of rage that shattered the temple's mosaic glass.
And Gork slammed his bastard into the floor. It landed head first and it was finally quiet. Unconscious or dead, Gork did not care.
*Let it die amongst the weak and altar offerings of marine life*
The baby landed amongst a pile of burnt bread and the torsoless head of the last priestess.
*My offering to Shion or Baal*

Gork and his warband left the destroyed temple.
Baal does not demand mercy or forgiveness, or even love or compassion
*Baal demands blood and action* was Gork's final thought as he walked away.

--- 
*thump thump thump*
Mork stood alone at the foot of the temple. Pious chanting of prayers and ritual offerings echoed and wafted down from the top of the temple. So grand was the temple's architecture and construction that none would know that it was razed and desecrated decades prior.

But now everyone knows, the high priestess shared her vision, of destroyers decades long past who returned to sack and pillage once again.
So they prayed. She and her followers did not run or hide or readied for battle.
They prayed with fervor that ignited faith in the desperate masses. They scurried up the steps to stone walls of the temple, gave offering and prayers for Shion to deliver them from the invaders.

And Mork stood alone at the foot of the temple. 
Mork knew the word of Shion and the prayers of Shion and the rituals of Shion, but Mork did not know the passion of the follower of Shion. He did not know the feeling of absolute faith and trust of Shion's grace. The certainty and passion of Shion's faithful was alien to Mork.

Mork unbuckled his book of faith from his belt, and held it in his left hand. He read it like the many times he did in the past. The words and prose were committed to his memory, the stories and thematic fables carved into his mind.
But still Mork's heart remained blank, like a block of stone waiting to be sculpted into the beautiful form of the master artist.
Or the faith of the holy priestess.

*thump thump Thump*

How many years did Mork spent in study of the book of Shion? How many hours or days did he spent in prayer to Shion? Where the Shionnite was filled with passion of belief, Mork was filled the deafening silence of apathy.
Doubly ironic for Mork, as he was an acolyte of Shion. A priest in training. 

A particularly beautiful parable of love and deliverance did Mork read, and many a times it brought tears to the faithful. And all of the times Mork eyes blinked dry. 
The only difference now is that Mork's sight was filtered through the slit of a poor knight's helmet, and his right hand did not held the censer, it held a hammer.

*Thump Thump Thump*

They found him as a baby, his infant skull caved in, and surrounded in the ruins of the temple and it's followers. They raised the ashened baby as it was on their own, unsure if he was a blessing or a curse.

And so for his entire life, Mork was raised in the temple, to be another of the Shions priests and preachers. Yet Mork could not bring himself to join his brothers and sisters in the temple now.
He could not bring himself to die amongst the faithful. The prayers of the faithful and offerings of the pious were like water to Mork's oil slick apathy.
Most significant of all was the high priestess. Her charisma and absolute faith of the will of Shion washed over the temple residents like a tsunami of religious fervor. Their faith became an ocean that submerge all in Shion's grace and love. They all basked in the fervor and with complete sincerity, they offered prayers and rituals of deliverance. 
And Mork was alone in their ocean, he became a solitary island in Shion's vast sea. Mork became a stranger amongst the many, he did not know them, he did not feel the words and passion, and they did not know him.

Mork would rather die alone at the steps of the temple. It would be just as solitary as dying up in the temple with the men and women who raised him.

**THUMP THUMP THUMP**

Mork stood alone at the foot of the temple.

**THUMP**
and stared at the massive Orc that walked a meter in front of a horde of hundreds.

The leader stood tall, a full head more vertical than the already tall Mork. 
In between the gaps of brutal and chaotic armor of ramshackled metal plates and spikes impaled with skulls, was inhuman muscles of orcish greenish grey. 
But most disturbing to Mork, was not his intimidating armor, the freshly spilt blood on his person, or the bone effigy sculpted to Baal, it was not his twin axes detailed with edges that may have ripped flesh instead of cleaved,
it was that the unadorned orc's face looked like Mork.

Mork buckled his book to his belt, saddened but not surprised at the silence of his own god. Resolved that his fate would be just as his own faith, meaningless, inconsequential.

The orc's army stopped at their leaders raised arm. He looked at Mork, and roared a bestial howl.
**"BAAL DEMANDS BLOOD AND ACTION!"**

--- 
Mork was knocked prone to the ground, his robes cut and tattered, his entire body waist up covered in deep cuts and missing flesh. His left arm hanged loosely, and his helmet was dented from the orcs furious blows.

Mork was violently introduced to the chasm that was the gap in skill between him and his opponent. For every swing of his hammer, the orc struck five. Once to batter away Mork's excuse of a weapon, and 4 more times to separate flesh from the body.

Mork scrambled up, instinctively knowing that he should be dead and that the only reason he is alive is because the orc wills it. The orc does not want to kill him, not quickly at least.

Before Mork could think his next thought, the orc slammed his own head into Mork. Mork fell down dazed and stunned, once again prone on his back. 

The echoes of temples prayers grew louder, as if the high priestess was leading her procession right next to the combatants.

The orc planted his heavy feet onto Mork's torso, pressing the air out of his chest. The chanting prayers reverberated upon this scene, the chanting more frantic and panic as cries of the despaired and children intermixed with recited prayers. 
A piercing howl loosed from the orc's chest, and bursting flames encircled the father and son. The orc's axe was engulfed in profane fire and he raised his arms up high readied to deliver his killing blow.

Death has arrived.

A desperate hammer strike landed upon the orc's knee. But instead of ineffectively bouncing off like all other times, the knee exploded in gore and the orc fell forward. Another hammer strike crunched into his skull and an unnatural explosion of orcish gore and blood rained upon Mork. 
His unbeknownst father ragdolled corpse pinned Mork down, the head giblets and the leg separated.

The fires and prayers reached their apex, and crescendoed into a whisper and faint ember.  The high priestess' procession in absolute joyous shock at Mork's impossible victory.

And as Mork laid there with his father's corpse bleeding all over him, flowing into his wounds and cuts, flowing to his holy book still attached at his belt, Mork experienced a feeling that was utterly new to him.

He saw it in his brothers and sisters, but never in himself. And now it burned so much brighter than any passive believer, that it engulfed Mork completely. An inferno raged inside of him and it was intoxicating, immediately addicting.


**Passion
Bloodlust**

--- 

The temple welcomed Mork with bellowing cheer. Festivities was about as the high priestess declared a miracle delivered through Mork, the invader's leader is dead and the army retreated through the will of Shion.

Everywhere Mork looked, he saw smiling faces from the gaggle of followers. His stature stood above them tall, deafly listening to their singing praises and short songs of his heroic deliverance. 

They rained grain and seed upon Mork as he walked. Offering gifts of bread or fish, or both or more praises, each one dimming the fire within Mork. All of their fervor now directed at Mork, but not one of them deigned to meet the invaders in battle with their fervor, thought Mork.
*Pathetic*

They worshipped the ground he walked on as it was sanctified by a living saint. Celebration was to be had, and a presumptuous young acolyte splashed a bucket of water on top of Mork, washing to fresh blood off, and dousing his fire to a dying ember. In the crowds laughter, Mork was already forgetting that intoxicating feeling.

He arrived at his destination, she stood in front of him on a raised platform, the high priestess congratulated him on his victory, but spoke not to him but to the crowd. She was mesmerizing, her charisma captured one's ears and her charming face grasped the eyes. Her very presence would not let go of it's hold. 
She was beautiful, angelic, not of this world. Her kind smile reached into her eyes, a beauty that touched the soul and places the will of god in the hearts of man.

She spoke of Shion's word and their own faithfulness, how piousness delivered them a miracle through Mork, and other such preaching. That through grain and bread and fish and-
Mork listened, and once again he was an alien, amongst the herd of sheep, he was a wolf clothed in wool.
And as he listened, the embers reignited. Slowly raising in heat, burning against the tide of faith preached by the priestess.
Her choir was reaching the apex, the crowd save Mork was enthralled. Every word spoken left the crowd starving for more. 
Her apex was here, she directed all to open their prayer books, to recite from the parable of love and deliverance. 

Mork's holy book still dripping with blood unperceived, inked itself unto the pages, rewriting words profane and heretical. Consecrated parchment defiled with the blood of the father. Prose replaced and laid upon Mork's eyes.

*By your scars and deeds, you shall be judged.
Abhor the passive
condemn the weak*

Mork heard Shion.

The fire reignited, burning furious within and Mork understood. 
He understood the fervor and passion, he understood the absolute certainty of faith accompanied by sheer will. He understood it now, now because he felt it so innately that it was now part of his being. 
He was disgusted at his past apathy that fueled aimlessness, meaningless. He had now experienced religious fervor, and he was intoxicated with the meaning that it imbued upon him. So intoxicating that Mork knew that he would never let it go.

His passion burned so meltingly hot it evaporated the wave of prose and parable laid upon him by the high priestess. Her words burnt to to nothingness as they approached his blaze.

He was an inferno now, and he could not hide.
For a moment, she knew, she a saw past his wool and for a moment, her kind eyes were gone and were now of disgust. She was a shepherd, and saw a wolf amongst her sheep.
She saw and now she could never forget.

She shifted back into her kind eyes, no one the wiser. All listening and grabbing onto her every words of promise of love and deliverance.

And Mork heard Shion.
Fratricidal blood unseen drippped from inside his metal helmet, fusing flesh to steel, 
Mork understood that Shion did not want for offerings of fish or grain,
or prayers or rituals by the passive and meek.
**Shion demands blood and action**
